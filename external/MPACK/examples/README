This directory contains some examples.

You must manually adjust compiler name, installation directory of mpack.
CXX...compiler name.
MPACKDIR...where you installed MPACK
          ./configure --prefix=/work/MPACK in this case
LIBFLAGS...where you installed mpack. in this case /work/MPACK/lib
GMPLIBS...complete flag to link against GMP version of mblas, mlapack
and gmp libs.
QDLIBS...complete flag to link against QD version of mblas, mlapack
and QD libs.
DDLIBS...complete flag to link against DD version of mblas, mlapack
and QD libs.

mpack/examples/mlapack contains:

1. Inversion of matrix by dd, qd, and GMP
inv_mat_qd.cpp
inv_mat_dd.cpp
inv_mat_gmp.cpp

2. Inversion of Hilbert matrix by dd, qd, GMP and IEEE754 double.
hilbert_dd.cpp
hilbert_qd.cpp
hilbert_gmp.cpp
hilbert.cpp (this is just for test blas.h and lapack.h from C compiler)

3. Obtain Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix
via Rsyev.
eigenvalue_dd.cpp
eigenvalue_qd.cpp
eigenvalue_gmp.cpp

mpack/examples/mblas contains:
1. matrix-matrix operation example via Rgemm (dgemm)
Rgemm_dd.cpp
Rgemm_gmp.cpp
Rgemm_qd.cpp
